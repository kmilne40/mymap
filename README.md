# MyMap -- Nmap wrapper

MyMap is a Python script written by Kev, improved by Hubert and Sophie. It is designed to automate many of the common tasks we encounter with Nmap.

It's important to note that it looks for the NSE scripts in /usr/share/nmap/scripts.  It will fail if it is not there so feel free to change line 80
in the code to point it in the right direction. :)

           MYMAP HELP GUIDE
======================================

MyMap is a wrapper around Nmap, providing a menu-driven interface to run nmap scripts, custom scans, 
and manage outputs and reports. This guide helps you understand the menu options and workflow.

USAGE:
- Run the script: `ex 'vrtkm.view' "'DATASETNAME'"` (z/OS example)
- For UNIX/Linux: `python pcaper.py` (if adapted)
(Adjust based on how you actually run your tool)

MAIN MENU OPTIONS:
- Enter a number (1-10) to choose from one of the Script Categories.
- 's' to search: Search for scripts by a keyword.
- 'c' for custom command: Input your own Nmap command line options (without 'nmap' at the start).
- 'd' for speed dial: Quickly run saved (favorited) commands.
- 'e' for edit settings: Adjust configuration options such as whether to always ask about output file,
  screen output, or report generation.
- 'h' for help: Displays this help information (what you're reading now).
- 'q' to quit: Exit the program.

AFTER CHOOSING A SCRIPT:
Youâ€™ll be prompted for:
- The target (IP, hostname, or file containing targets).
- The port options (e.g., -p 80 or a port range).
- Whether to output results to a file (if configured).
- Whether to view output on screen.
- Whether to generate a penetration testing report.

SEARCHING SCRIPTS:
- Type 's' at main menu, enter a search term.
- Choose a script from the search results and run it as above.

CUSTOM COMMANDS:
- Type 'c' at main menu.
- Enter custom Nmap arguments (without the 'nmap' command).
- View and report on output if desired.
- Possibly add to speed dial if target is an IP.

SPEED DIAL:
- Type 'd' at main menu.
- View saved commands, add new ones, delete old ones.
- Run a saved command quickly without retyping everything.

EDIT SETTINGS:
- Type 'e' at main menu.
- Toggle configuration options (like whether to ask about output files or reports every time).

HELP:
- Type 'h' at main menu to view this help file.

QUIT:
- Type 'q' at main menu to exit the tool.

======================================
       ADDITIONAL NOTES
======================================
- Ensure 'nmap' is installed and in your PATH.
- Ensure 'config.json' is properly configured.
- Ensure required Python dependencies (like termcolor, tqdm) are installed.
- The help file is subject to improvements over time.

======================================
       END OF HELP
